## About project:

This project is a simplified drawing program without the ability to add any image to it or save a drawn picture... damn.
Like most successful projects, this project is made in a minimalist style and in a dark theme with a minimal set of features.
Suitable for users who want to learn how to move the cursor on the screen and press buttons and show imagination in black and white pixel art.
